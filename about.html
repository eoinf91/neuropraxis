    <meta name="title" content="NeuroPraxis - Restoring quality of life after brain injury">
    <meta name="description" content="NeuroPraxis is an innovative home and community rehabilitation program for brain injury serving Southern California. We recognize that after a brain injury, life is not often the same and recovery can be a challenge to everyone involved. This may mean learning a new normal. Brain Injury has associated long-term effects that have potential risks including re-hospitalization. We provide education, mentorship, resource development, and sustainable community support to empower, actualize, and build a sense of self-efficacy.">

        <h2>About N<span class="smallcaps">euro</span>P<span class="smallcaps">raxis</span></h2>
        <p>Headquartered in Southern California, NeuroPraxis is bridging the gap in the continuum of brain injury care by providing individualized outcome-oriented rehabilitation programs and evidence-based practices that are geared toward preventing long-term risks, such as re-hospitalization, further complications, and skill regression, that often occur after other extensive and costly brain injury rehabilitation programs.</p>
        <p>Collectively, our staff has over 50 years of experience in brain injury recovery. Much more than a traditional therapy program, we help participants find a renewed sense of confidence, establish a sustainable support system, learn self-advocacy, develop a determination to succeed, and find purpose by creating an environment that promotes healing and empowerment to help our participants reach their maximum potential.</p>

        <h2>Why N<span class="smallcaps">euro</span>P<span class="smallcaps">raxis</span></h2>
        <p>At NeuroPraxis, we believe that life is meant to be lived and each participant has the right to a healthy, joyful, and thriving life once they return home as it’s the cornerstone to the reconstruction of a coherent self, regaining a sense of autonomy and finding hope in life after brain injury.</p>
        <p>We are driven by a profound commitment to helping each individual reintegrate back into their community and actively pursue optimized independence and well-being.</p>
        <p>Effective rehabilitation is more than healing through therapy – it’s about rebuilding lives. And we’re available every step of the way.</p>

    <meta name="title" content="NeuroPraxis - Restoring quality of life after brain injury">
    <meta name="description" content="NeuroPraxis is an innovative home and community rehabilitation program for brain injury serving Southern California. We recognize that after a brain injury, life is not often the same and recovery can be a challenge to everyone involved. This may mean learning a new normal. Brain Injury has associated long-term effects that have potential risks including re-hospitalization. We provide education, mentorship, resource development, and sustainable community support to empower, actualize, and build a sense of self-efficacy.">

                    <h4>Home and Community Rehabilitation</h4>
                    <p>NeuroPraxis provides in-home and community rehabilitation programs in the participant’s home environment. Studies have shown that home care is the best setting for recovery for an increasing number of patients. Not only is home rehabilitation often less expensive than in-patient facility care, evidence suggests that home care is a key step toward achieving optimal health outcomes for many patients.</p>
                    <p>Through individual rehabilitation plans, NeuroPraxis provides outcome-based therapy programs with a focus on maximizing independence, improving overall wellness and productivity, preventing further injuries, and enhancing quality of life for each participant. The NeuroPraxis team includes highly-skilled rehabilitation specialists who provide the latest in evidence-based care.</p>

                    <h4>Integrated Living</h4>
                    <p>At NeuroPraxis, we bring specialized TBI rehabilitation techniques into the nurturing environment of family homes. It’s a whole new paradigm in treating TBI patients. This program is structured within a home-like setting where individuals with brain injury can continue to develop their cognitive, motor, psycho-social and independent living skills in a secure neighborhood environment with the support of experienced medical and rehabilitation professionals that help them transition from medical care to living within a supportive, family-like environment. Ideally, this should be a nurturing environment with experienced care partners, where participants get the care and support they need to become more self-sufficient and restore their quality of life—long-term.</p>
                    <p>Just as TBI can be life changing, so, too, is finding the right place to live for patients. Integrating individually designed outcome-oriented and evidence-based rehabilitation approaches into nurturing family homes represents a new paradigm in treating TBI patients, where patients get the care and support necessary to become more self-sufficient and restore their quality of life—long-term.</p>
                    <p>NeuroPraxis is proud to be a Care Partner with Agape Home Care, whose care providers/owners deliver the nurturing environment of a family home. They offer the ideal environment for TBI patients to thrive in — small, six-bed homes with live-in staff. This inspires the highest commitment to care.</p>

                    <h4>Transitional Apartment Living</h4>
                    <p>This program is designed for individuals who are ready to live with increased independence – either on their own or with a roommate – with continued support from the NeuroPraxis team at a lower level of supervision.</p>
                    <p>Our rehabilitation team provides support and coaching with daily living activities (i.e. bathing, dressing, feeding, etc.), higher independent living skills (cooking, budgeting, a/vocational re-entry, meal planning, etc.), and therapy designated tasks throughout the day.</p>
                    <p>We encourage a healthy lifestyle, from simple housekeeping and nutritious meals to hygiene and healthcare, and strive to enable our participants to lead their own lives in a way that keeps them happy, healthy and determined in an environment where they can seamlessly reintegrate back into their community, experience positive behavior interventions, and practice building independent living skills.</p>
                    <p>The apartments are conveniently located near restaurants, parks, shopping, hospitals, churches, and more, with public transportation and assistance available to make every day a day with endless possibilities.</p>
